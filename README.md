# 8bitrockstars_demo

This is a self contained frontend application which runs via a Node/Express server and renders views with React. It's just a demo, there is no database. The project is, however, fully ready to interact with and consume data from an API.

To run:
`npm i`, `npm run build`, `npm start`

The application runs on port 3000.


UX Flow:

1. Login using any made up credentials
2. Redirect to dashboard page
3. Add a user by clicking the big blue button
4. Add a group by clicking the "Add a group" link in the bottom right
5. Modify a user's groups via the select node inside the user
